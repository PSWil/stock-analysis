# Stock Market Analysis

	## Project Overview

		### Background
		For this challenge I was asked by a friend Steve to analyze a group of 12 stocks that his parents were looking to invest in. In order to do this I created an interactive workbook using Visual Basic Application (VBA) in 			Excel to provide the return on investment (ROI) and the annual volume of each stock. To help visualize the information the cells which output the data are color cordinated to help quickly see trends in the stock. Buttons 		are provided in the work book so that the code can quickly be run and reset.
		
		### Purpose
		Steve is happy with the workbook and would like to use it to analyze an larger volume of stocks, to do this we need to refactor the code so that it can run through all the data more efficently.

	## Results
